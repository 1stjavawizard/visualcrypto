## Description of Cryptocurrency Exchange Website
The cryptocurrency exchange website is designed to provide users with a seamless trading experience while incorporating machine learning for sentiment analysis. Key components and functionalities include:

- **Frontend Interface**: Developed using modern web technologies, the frontend interface offers users intuitive access to trading features, market data, and user account management.

- **Machine Learning for Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiments from various sources such as social media, news articles, and forums. The sentiment analysis model provides insights into market trends and user sentiments, aiding traders in decision-making.

- **AWS Lambda Functions**: Implements serverless computing for trade execution, data processing, and scheduled tasks. Lambda functions ensure scalability, cost-efficiency, and low-latency response times.

- **Database**: Utilizes a scalable and reliable database (e.g., Amazon DynamoDB) to store user data, transaction history, sentiment analysis results.


## Running the Application
1. Navigate to the directory containing the frontend of the website by using the `cd` command:

    ```bash
    cd "Frontend of website"
    ```

2. Launch the `index.html` file in a web browser:

    - Open your preferred web browser.
    - Navigate to the file menu or address bar.
    - Enter the path to the `index.html` file or drag and drop the file into the browser window.
    - Press Enter to load the webpage.



## Conclusion
The cryptocurrency exchange website integrates cutting-edge technologies to deliver a robust and feature-rich trading platform. By leveraging machine learning for sentiment analysis, serverless architecture with AWS Lambda functions, and a scalable database, the platform empowers users with valuable insights and seamless trading experiences.
